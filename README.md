## ToDos:

 * Web/Mail Design/Sitemap/Navigation - Foundation

 * Use Charts to display data (e.g. Who owes you?)

 * Implement auto-complete when inviting user/participant

 * DRY out the code: partials, (mail) view helpers, JavaScript, etc.

 * Tests: Views (functional), Integration Tests

 * Look into CI for HTML/JavaScript: Selenium/PhantomJS, SauceLab, .... ?

 * Soft delete a user

 * Notification stream for user

 * Search engine for events/items

 * User can type in base amount

 * Make tables sortable

 * Cash flow details per participant (see Johanna M. for design)

 * Track withdrawals/exchange rates

 * Improve accessibility for screen readers e.g.

 * Export functionalities

 * Format amount fields on edit/new item pages

 * Reduce import files (SASS, JS/jQuery, ...) -> selected imports

 * ...

	* Ruby version: 2.2.0 (Contains a [bug] with BigDecimal? Use Rational class?)
