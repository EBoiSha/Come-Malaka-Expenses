# README

**This app is still in beta. Feel free to feed back or to join.**

Uses of 3rd party software for development and testing: mailcatch

## ToDos:

 * Web/Mail Design/Sitemap/Navigation

 * We need a code style guide (JSHint, CSSLint, Checkstyle, GitHub style guide)...

 * ...and documentation (readme.io)...

 * ...and to be responsive (for those with slow connections)...

 * Use Charts to display data (e.g. Who owes you?)

 * Implement auto-complete when inviting user/participant

 * DRY out the code: partials, (mail) view helpers, JavaScript, etc.

 * Refactor:
 	* Value objects, Service objects, Form objects, Query objects, View objects, Policy objects, Decorators...

 * Tests: Integration Tests

 * Look into CI for HTML/JavaScript: Selenium/PhantomJS, SauceLab, .... ?

 * Notification stream for user

 * Search engine for events/items

 * User can type in base amount?

 * Make tables sortable

 * Make use of aggregation/map-reduce framework

 * Track withdrawals/exchange rates

 * Improve accessibility for screen readers e.g.

 * Export functionalities

 * Format amount fields on edit/new item pages

 * ...

 * Incorporate user feedback:
 	* Possibility to enter a global amount for an item and then to split it in a different % to the participants
